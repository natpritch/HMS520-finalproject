Creating a package to produce data vetting plots

[What's in it]
This package includes the code to produce an example dataset and the function to produce a standard vetting plot for GBD data to review how a variable of interest for a particular cause and selected list of countries has changed over time. 

[Scripts to review]
R code/GBD Vetting Plots.R

[Tests Developed]
Plotting function is tested for one country to visually confirm it is working correctly before looping through all countries in the dataset and producing a compiled pdf of plots with one country per page. 

[How to Test/Run]
Start an RStudio session
Open the script and edit the options for user to select
Run the .R file to generate the test plot
Visually check the test plot 
If all looks good, then continue running code in .R file to produce pdf of plots in working directory
