Creating a package

# The overall goal of the project
Produce plots across years (x-axis) for vetting an estimate of interest that can loop through to separate out disease causes, or age groups, or countries/subnationals, or sexes (as selected by the input of the package user).

# Detailed plans and timeline:
Step 1. Make a test dataset - week one

Step 2. make plotting function - week one

Step 3. test plotting function on one output option - week two 

Step 4. make the lists of options the user can choose to loop through (disease causes, or age groups, or countries/subnationals, or sexes) - week two

Step 5. print out multiple plots in a pdf using for loop - week three
